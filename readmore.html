            Influence-based pathfinding is an algorithm I developed in my
            research, alongside a team of six under the Rutgers Aresty Research
            Program. It's created by combining the techniques of hierarchical
            pathfinding, A*, and influence maps.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          <b>The situation: </b>We wanted to create a pathfinding algorithm that
          is better applicable to human environments. The problem with current
          pathfinding algorithms is that they're static and generally based on
          finding the shortest path from a start to a goal. Human environments
          operate in opposing ways. Our environment is always changing due to
          traffic and infrastructure, and we travel based on how we're feeling.
          Maybe we want to avoid crowds? Maybe we want to take the scenic route?
        </p>
        <p>
          My job was to implement the HPA* algorithm and make it more dynamic.
          What's cool about HPA* is that it's best used for large environments,
          much like our own world. After that, we added <i>influence maps</i> to
          replicate human feelings and stimuli.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The results: </b>The result was a working demo that simulates
          humans that avoids crowd congestion. Here's a screenshot of that demo
          below, with the influence maps visible in many colors, agents in dark
          blue, and the path chosen in cyan. I even got to present these results
          at a poster session for my program.

        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, this was an interesting experience, since this was the first
          time I got to contribute something new to the field in a professional
          setting. If I were to revisit this project, I would definitely fix the
          efficiency of the project!

            This Untitiled Bullet Hell Game is my current project, as part of
            the #100DaysOfGameDev challenge on Twitter. This video game is a
            homage to the bullet hell genre, with a modern twist. I'm developing
            this game solo through Unity.

            This short video game was the first video game I've ever created and
            deployed! Like my Untitled Bullet Hell Game, this is another homage
            to the bullet hell genre, but in small doses to explore mental
            health in video games.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          <b>The situation: </b>Mental health in video games is one of my
          favorite topics. As someone struggling with my own mental health
          issues, I care deeply about opening the dialogue about it. I find that
          one of the best ways I can contribute to that movement is by making
          games that addresses it. Video games are an interesting medium such
          that they're interactive, unlike most media like movies or visuals. We
          can present a stronger message to the audience because of this
          interactivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since this was my first game, I attempted to make it as quickly as
          possible. This way, I can learn the most about video game development
          without overwhelming myself with work. The game features a little
          character, who is crying alone. The player can deal with this
          situation in various ways, such as crying it out, or reaching out to
          someone. My hope is that players get to learn more about how people
          deal with their mental health. Hence a small "note on crying."
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The results: </b> I ultimately finished this game within 4 days.
          It's a very short game, and can be finished within minutes. This was
          quite hectic though! Everything is basically held by sticks and
          strings. I learned the importance of project planning however. If I
          were to redo this game, then I would spend more time planning it. Now,
          project planning is one of my favorite steps of my projects! I hope to
          make more games about mental health in the future.

            This was an academic project developed in a pair. The goal was to
            make a clone of chess, but as an Android app.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          <b>The situation: </b>This project was assigned as we were learning
          about design patterns in OOP. So, the full task was to make a clone of
          chess, but also used what we've learned to make the app more efficient
          for the user and the programmer. Another interesting feature we were
          tasked to add was to make a replay feature. This way, players can save
          their game and review the moves that they made during the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The results: </b> Just as you expect, a working app - simple, but
          functional! I found that working with Android and Android Studio was
          actually easy The UI and serialization in Android are very similar to
          those in Java, a language I'm fluent in. Also, we didn't find the need
          to implement a lot of design patterns, If I were to revisit this
          project though, I would still attempt to implement them regardless.
          This is because, at the very least, all screens can return to previous
          screens and can exit the app. That kind of functionality, though
          small, can still be shared efficiently. I would also added some polish
          to make the game more exciting, such as by including animations. I'm a
          indie game developer after all! I'd love to work more with apps in Android!

            This was another academic project, again built in a pair. This time,
            the goal was to create a photo library from scratch, with JavaFX.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          <b>The situation: </b>Much like for the Android project above, this
          project was meant to teach us about design patterns. The main
          functions of this app included, but was not limited to: a simple login
          system, loading photos from anywhere on the device into the app,
          tagging photos, and searching for photos based on those tags.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The results: </b>Another working app! Unlike the Android project,
          this project would have benefitted from design patterns. I did not
          take advantage of them as I should have. If given the time, I would
          most likely redo the entire architecture of this project!
